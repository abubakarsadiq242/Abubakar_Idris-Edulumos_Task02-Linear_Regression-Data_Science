# Abubakar_Idris-Edulumos_Task02-Linear_Regression-Data_Science
House Price Prediction project using Linear Regression in Python and Scikit-learn. The model predicts house prices based on features like size, bedrooms, bathrooms, age, and location score. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²), and visualization in Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Linear Regression in Python** to predict house prices based on multiple features such as:
- Size of the house (square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Age of the house
- Location score

The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and price using regression analysis.
